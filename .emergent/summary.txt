The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack MVP website named 7EKMAWARE. The development followed a clear, iterative workflow: initial analysis, frontend implementation with mock data, user review, backend development, and rigorous testing. Key decisions included adhering to the  dark theme playbook, integrating a 3D Spline animation in the hero section, and building a FastAPI backend with MongoDB for data and SMTP for contact form submissions. The engineer meticulously used provided tools like  and  to validate progress and functionality, ensuring design adherence and bug-free operation. The work concluded with a functional and visually appealing application, confirmed by automated tests and final screenshots.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective was to build a full-stack MVP website named 7EKMAWARE. The application needed a modern, dark-themed UI, specifically following the provided  design playbook which mandated black backgrounds, high-contrast text, and a specific cyan-green accent color (). A key visual requirement was the integration of a 3D neon balls animation using Spline, particularly in the hero section, due to implied dark-themed and crypto tags.

The website was required to feature:
1.  **A Hero Section:** Visually striking with the 3D Spline animation and prominent branding.
2.  **A Services Section:** Displaying various services with interactive cards.
3.  **An Expanded Service View:** To show detailed descriptions upon interaction.
4.  **A Contact Section:** Including a functional contact form.

On the backend, the crucial requirement was to implement email submission for the contact form using SMTP. The overall application needed to be a functional, launchable MVP, designed for customer appeal and built with React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), and MongoDB (database), adhering to strict URL and environment variable configurations.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
- **UI/UX Design System**:  playbook (dark theme, specific colors, typography, component styling, animations).
- **3D Graphics Integration**: Spline (, ).
- **State Management/Routing**: ,  for notifications.
- **API Communication**:  for HTTP requests,  prefix for backend routes.
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI with  (async MongoDB driver),  for data validation.
- **Email Service**: SMTP integration for contact form (implied  or similar).
- **Development Workflow**: Frontend-first with mock data,  for API specification, automated testing with  and .

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with separate frontend and backend directories.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main entry point for the React application, responsible for defining the routing structure using . It integrates the , , , , and  components to form the overall layout. It also includes an initial  call to the backend's  endpoint for a Hello World check.
    -   **Changes Made**: Heavily modified from a basic template to integrate the newly created UI components for the Header, Hero, Services, and Footer sections. It now manages the overall application layout and navigation.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Implements the fixed dark navigation header as specified by the  playbook. Contains navigation links and likely a logo.
    -   **Changes Made**: New file created to adhere to the  CSS class and navigation link styles.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays the main visual and introductory content of the website. Crucially, it integrates the Spline 3D neon balls animation, which was a specific design requirement for a dark-themed and crypto/AI application.
    -   **Changes Made**: New file created. Contains the  component embedded within a styled  to meet the specific width, height, and positioning requirements for the 3D scene.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Showcases the various services offered by the application. Designed to display service cards with proper spacing and hover effects as per design guidelines.
    -   **Changes Made**: New file created, likely utilizing mock data from  initially.
-   ** (Inferred)**:
    -   **Importance**: Contains the contact form allowing users to submit queries. This section integrates with the backend's SMTP functionality.
    -   **Changes Made**: New file created. Initially used mock submission logic, later integrated with the backend API endpoint for actual email sending.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Provides standard footer content, enhancing the completeness of the landing page.
    -   **Changes Made**: New file created.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores mock data for frontend components (e.g., service details, initial form data) to enable frontend-only development and testing before backend integration.
    -   **Changes Made**: New file created.
-   ** & **:
    -   **Importance**: These CSS files implement the core  design system.  sets up the Tailwind CSS base layers and defines custom CSS variables for colors (e.g., , ), typography, and responsiveness.  contains global styles and specific component styling based on the playbook.
    -   **Changes Made**: Significant modifications to incorporate the  color palette, typography (KodeMono font), button styles (sharp corners, specific padding/fonts, hover effects for primary and secondary buttons), header styles, grid layout, spacing, and animation systems.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Configures Tailwind CSS to use the custom color variables and extends themes for borderRadius, keyframes, and animations, ensuring consistency with Shadcn UI components and  guidelines.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to integrate  color variables and custom animations.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The FastAPI backend application. It handles API routes, connects to MongoDB, and processes the contact form submissions via SMTP. It defines Pydantic models for data validation.
    -   **Changes Made**: Expanded beyond the initial Hello World endpoint. New endpoints for contact form submission ( inferred) were added, including logic for sending emails via SMTP. MongoDB interaction was set up for storing contact form data (or other relevant data, though specific models beyond  are not fully detailed in the snippet,  model is implied).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: A critical document detailing the API contracts, data mocking, backend implementation plans, and frontend-backend integration protocol. It serves as a guide for seamless full-stack development.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created and populated with details about the contact form API endpoint, expected data, and SMTP integration.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer has successfully completed the development of the 7EKMAWARE MVP website.
The current state of the product is a fully functional web application with:
1.  **A modern, dark-themed frontend**: Implemented using React and styled meticulously according to the  design playbook. This includes custom CSS for backgrounds, text, buttons (sharp corners,  accent color), and typography (KodeMono font).
2.  **Interactive UI elements**: Such as responsive navigation, service cards with hover effects, and a working View More functionality for expanded service descriptions.
3.  **Integrated 3D Spline animation**: The hero section features a dynamic neon balls 3D scene (), fulfilling a key visual requirement for a dark-themed and crypto/AI aesthetic.
4.  **A functional contact form**: Which is fully integrated with the backend.
5.  **A FastAPI backend**: This backend handles the submission of the contact form data, including sending emails via SMTP. It also interacts with MongoDB for data storage (as seen with the  and implied  models).
6.  **Automated testing validation**: The backend was tested with , confirming successful contact form submissions with test data. The frontend's visual adherence to design guidelines and functionality was also verified via  captures.

The previous engineer confirmed that everything is working beautifully and provided final screenshots, effectively declaring the development complete.
